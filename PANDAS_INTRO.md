   - War financing patterns during conflict periods
   - Seasonal patterns in banking activity

4. **Moving averages and trends**
   - Calculate 90-day moving average of transaction volumes
   - Identify peak activity periods

---

### **Module 5: Advanced Filtering & Queries **

**Learning Objectives:**
- Complex boolean indexing
- Query syntax
- Multi-condition filtering

**Hands-on Activities:**
1. **Find specific transaction types**
   - All papal deposits over 10,000 florins
   - War financing to Republic of Florence
   - Bills of exchange between specific branches

2. **Complex queries**
   ```python
   papal_war_loans = df.query('type == "war_financing" and counterparty.str.contains("Pope")')
   ```

3. **Account analysis**
   - Track all transactions affecting "Cash" account
   - Analyze loan repayments with interest components
   - Revenue vs expense patterns

---

### **Module 6: Data Transformation & Feature Engineering **

**Learning Objectives:**
- Create calculated columns
- Apply custom functions
- Reshape data (pivot, melt, merge)

**Hands-on Activities:**
1. **Create derived metrics**
   - Total transaction value (debit + credits)
   - Extract interest amounts from loan repayments
   - Calculate transaction fees from bills of exchange

2. **Categorize transactions**
   - Create "transaction_size" categories (small/medium/large)
   - Flag high-value transactions (>10,000 florins)
   - Identify multi-account transactions

3. **Branch comparison tables**
   ```python
   pivot = df.pivot_table(
       values='debit_amount',
       index='branch',
       columns='type',
       aggfunc='sum'
   )
   ```
